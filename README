    data from GeoNames

VERSION

DESCRIPTION
    "ElasticSearchX::Autocomplete::GeoNames" provides
    country/region/city/town/village autocompete suggestions by building
    autocomplete indexes from GeoNames data (see
    <http://www.geonames.org/>).

    This is an alpha module, completely lacking docs and tests at the
